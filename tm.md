# true meaning of my name
After thinking for a while, I think that the old name doesn't represent me well in general. Sometimes you guys confuse me with the guy name "duy", yeah, only "duy" with SofM as example.

Therefore, I decide to refresh my identity, which is my honest decision so far.

Here is the true meaning of my name:

d=duyanh

h=hwengwuok

6=six, it includes:

The legacies of 1b1a***6*** Incorporation, the first number of my mechanical keyboard that doesn't working (n,h,y,***6*** and f5), the end of my primary phone number (61***6***), sums of all numbers in my date of birth (2+8+2+4=1***6***)  

k=one of the word "kk" in my old name, inherits from the old ones.

## Note: I will still use the old name (duyladuykk, dldkk) for some websites because those sites cannot change my old nicknames.  Although it is seen as respecting my old heritage, in the future, these names will no longer be used (I swear).
## You can still contact me using that old name, or this new name, all of them are ok.
